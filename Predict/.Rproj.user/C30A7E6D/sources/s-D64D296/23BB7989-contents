### Here I make up a time series
time = 1:100
X = time*.5 + rnorm(100,0,4)
plot(time, X, type='l')


## First Differences
first.diffs = diff(X)
plot(first.diffs, type = "l", ylab = "First Differences", xlab = "Time")

## Second Differences
second.diffs = diff(first.diffs)
plot(second.diffs,type='l')




### Now I look at the seasonal data: Turkey
Turkey.data = read.csv('Turkey.csv')
time = 1:nrow(Turkey.data)
turkey = Turkey.data$Turkey
plot(time,turkey,type='l',lwd=2)
acf(turkey) #major autocorrelation on 12th lag!

## Seasonal Differences
d = 12 # space between seasonal effects
seasonal.diffs = diff(turkey,lag = d)
plot(seasonal.diffs,type='l') #note change in the magnitude of the y-axis!
acf(seasonal.diffs) # much better, but not perfect.
